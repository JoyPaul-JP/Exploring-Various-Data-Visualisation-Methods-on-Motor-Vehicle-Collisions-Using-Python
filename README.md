# Exploring-Various-Data-Visualisation-Methods-on-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Using-Python
The project titled "Exploring Various Data Visualisation Methods on Motor Vehicle Collisions Using Python" focuses on analyzing motor vehicle collision data through a range of data visualization techniques to identify underlying trends, patterns, and anomalies. A total of 12 different types of plots were implemented—including bar plots, pie charts, area plots, heat maps, line charts, and mosaic plots—to present multidimensional insights into collision frequency, causes, timing, and locations. The project was developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, with Power BI for enhanced dashboard reporting. Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, along with Pandas for data manipulation, were used to build an interactive and comprehensive analytical framework. This project supports better understanding of traffic safety dynamics and data-driven decision-making for road safety initiatives.
